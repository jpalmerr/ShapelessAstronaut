use shapeless to derive type class instances for product types (i.e. case classes)

- If we have type class instances for the head and tail of an HList,
    we can derive an instance for the whole HList.
    
- If we have a `case class A`, a `Generic[A]`, and a type class instance for the `genericâ€™s Repr`,
    we can combine them to create an instance for `A`.
