The main idea behind generic programming is to solve problems for a wide variety of types by
writi􏰀ng a small amount of generic code.

Shapeless provides two sets of tools to this end:

1. a set of generic data types that can be inspected, traversed,
   and manipulated at the type level

2. automati􏰀c mapping between algebraic data types (ADTs) (encoded in Scala as case classes and sealed traits)
   and these generic representations.
